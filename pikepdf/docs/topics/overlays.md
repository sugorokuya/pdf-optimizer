# Overlays, underlays, watermarks, n-up

You can use pikepdf to overlay pages or other content on top of other pages.

This might be used to do watermarks (typically an underlay, drawn before everything
else), n-up (compositing multiple individual pages on a large page, such as converting
slides from a presentation to 4-up for reading and printing).

If you are looking to merge pages from different PDFs, see {ref}`mergepdf`.

In this example we use {meth}`pikepdf.Page.add_overlay` to draw a thumbnail of
of the second page onto the first page.

```python
>>> from pikepdf import Pdf, Page, Rectangle

>>> pdf = Pdf.open(...)

>>> destination_page = Page(pdf.pages[0])

>>> thumbnail = Page(pdf.pages[1])

>>> destination_page.add_overlay(thumbnail, Rectangle(0, 0, 300, 300))

>>> pdf.save("page1_with_page2_thumbnail.pdf")
```

The {class}`pikepdf.Rectangle` specifies the position on the target page into which
the other page can be drawn. The object will be drawn centered in a way that
fills as much space as possible while preserving aspect ratio.

Use {meth}`pikepdf.Page.add_underlay` instead if you want content drawn underneath.
It is possible content drawn this way will be overdrawn by other objects.

Use {attr}`pikepdf.Page.trimbox` to get a page's dimensions.

`add_overlay` will copy content across `Pdf` objects as needed, and can copy
other pages or other Form XObjects.

`add_overlay` also preserves aspect ratio.
Use {meth}`pikepdf.Page.as_form_xobject` and
{meth}`pikepdf.Page.calc_form_xobject_placement` if you want more precise control
over placement.

Composition works using Form XObjects, which is how PDF captures of a group of
related objects for drawing. Some very basic PDF software may not support them,
or may fail to detect images contained within.

When perform n-up composition, it will work better to create your composition
within the existing document, rather than in a new document. Transforming the
existing document will ensure that metadata, annotations and hyperlinks are
preserved. For example, to convert 16 slides to 4Ã—4-up pages for printing,
add four pages onto the end of the file, draw the slides onto the target pages,
and then delete the slides.

By default, `add_overlay` encapsulates the existing content stream in a way
that ensures the transformation matrix is first reset, since this behavior
aligns with user expectations. This adds a `q/Q` pair to (push/pop graphics
stack) to existing content streams. To disable this (usually desired) behavior
use `push_stack=False`.
